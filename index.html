                this is an adorable orange/reddish fuzzy moth. not sure what its name is, but he looks like he'd be a
                good pal to our snail friend up there.

                oooh, a cool beetle. kind of looks like a stinkbug, but far prettier. I like his lil purple head, and
                I'm sure our snail would, too.
